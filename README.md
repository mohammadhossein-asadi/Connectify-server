# Connectify Social Media Back-End Documentation
Project Overview
**The Connectify Social Media back-end is the backbone of the platform's functionality, handling user data, authentication, content management, and more. It is built using a combination of technologies to ensure security, efficiency, and seamless data handling.**

## Technologies Used
- Express
- Mongoose
- Bcrypt
- Helmet
- Morgan
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Multer
- Multer-gridfs
# Features
# User Data Management
The back-end utilizes Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool, to manage user data. This includes user profiles, authentication credentials, and engagement metrics. Bcrypt is used to securely hash and store passwords in the database.

# Authentication and Security
Connectify employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication. JWTs are generated upon successful login and are used to authenticate API requests. Helmet enhances security by setting various HTTP headers to prevent common web vulnerabilities.

# Content Management
The back-end handles user-generated content, including text posts and images. Multer and Multer-gridfs are used to manage image uploads and storage, ensuring efficient handling of media content.

# API Logging
Morgan is integrated to log API requests and responses, aiding in debugging and performance monitoring.

# Getting Started
To set up the Connectify Social Media back-end on your local machine, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository from GitHub.
- Navigate to the back-end directory.
- Install dependencies using yarn install.
- Configure environment variables for MongoDB connection, JWT secret, etc.
- Run the server with yarn start or yarn dev.
# Conclusion
The Connectify Social Media back-end provides the necessary infrastructure to support user interactions, content sharing, and community engagement. Through the use of Express, Mongoose, JWT, and other technologies, it ensures secure and efficient data management while enabling the front-end to deliver a seamless user experience.
